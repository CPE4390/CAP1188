# CAP1188  

Code for my capacitive touch demo boards using the Microchip CAP1188  
Runs on PIC18F87J11 or similar uController.   
Currently configured for 4-wire SPI interface.  

## Suggested improvements/additions 
* Add functions for I2C interface  
* Configure for multiple touches
* Improve functions for configuring LED's, etc.
